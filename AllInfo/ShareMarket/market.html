<font color="#fdff70">1. CAGR</font> :- Rate per year. 
 Eg. Infy has 10% gain per year

<font color="#fdff70">2. P/E ratio</font> :- It shows how expensive share is. Eg infy has 10:1 pe. It means one is paying 100 more than value of share but accenture has 20:1 so it is very
expensive compare to infy means more confident also.

<font color="#fdff70">3. Debt to equity ratio</font> :- company taking debt compare to self value of share. Means if ratio is 2:1 then company has taken 2x loan + 1x self value= total
investment. Higher value means if company's returns are not good then it will downfall very badly inshort "RISKY"

<font color="#fdff70">4. PAT</font> :- profit after tax. Higher PAT is better obvio.

<font color="#fdff70">5. ROE</font> :- return on equity. Total profit gain on total assets is ROE. Higher the ROE better is performance.

<font color="#fdff70">6. P/B ratio</font> :- The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value. The market value of a company is its share price multiplied by the
number of outstanding shares. The book value is the net assets of a company. ... Overvalued growth stocks frequently show a combination of low ROE and
high P/B ratios

<font color="#fdff70">7. EPS</font> :- Earning per share ie
total profit / total no. of shares. Higher eps better performance  

</font><font size="5" style="font-weight: bold;"><br></font></div><div><font size="5"><b><br></b></font></div><font size="5"><b>What if the stock has very high PE?
</b></font><span style="font-size: 17.6px;">
The PE ratio can be high for stock only if either the price is very high or if the earnings per share is very low. The combined effect then produces a very high PE stock.

When a stock trades at fair value and suddenly its EPS drives down to a very low value due to poor performance in the quarter or any time period, the stocks PE skyrockets to a very high value.

<i>E.g. JK Lakshmi Cement once reached 3000x PE.</i>

General characteristics of these stocks are as follows

<b><font color="#fdff70">Overvalued</font></b>: These stocks are highly overvalued as the market has not adjusted to the price linked to the performance of the stock

<b><font color="#fdff70">Low EPS:</font></b> Mathematically if the EPS or the denominator in the PE ratio falls below 1, the PE ratio obtained is very high.

<b><font color="#fdff70">High volatility</font></b>: Generally these stocks have high potential volatility as they are overvalued. The market condition will tame the high price and gradually will reduce the overvalued. Hence, the sustenance of price is less likely.
Unstable growth perspective: The stocks have not performed well in the previous period and most of them are looking for a revival in the market.</span><div><span style="font-size: 17.6px;"><br></span></div><div><i style="font-size: large;"><font color="#fdff70">All Definitions gathered and combined by
